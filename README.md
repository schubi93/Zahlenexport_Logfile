# logfile_analysis_for_random_experiment

A small program to extract data from a expiremts. The experiment was part of a master thesis of a friend of mine.

## Getting Started

Written in C++ but in a procedural way.

## Running the tests

The program is searching for a file called "eingabe.txt" in the folder. The program extracts the desired values out of this logfile and writes them into "Zahlenliste.csv". Also, the "Zahlenmatrix.txt" is written parallel to check the data before further steps. From there on, the file is opened in Excel, where further data processing occurs. This sheet ain't part of this project.
