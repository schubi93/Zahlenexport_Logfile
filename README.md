# logfile_analysis_for_random_experiment

A small program to extract data from an experiemt. The experiment was part of a master thesis of a friend of mine.

## Getting Started

Written in C++ but in a procedural way.

## Running the tests

The program is searching for a file in the same folder called "eingabe.txt". The program extracts the desired numbers out of this logfile and writes them into "Zahlenliste.csv". Also, the document "Zahlenmatrix.txt" is written parallel to check the data visually before further steps. From there on, the file is opened in Excel, where further data processing occurs. This excel-sheet ain't part of this project.
